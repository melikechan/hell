# hell - where the learning algorithms are written in C/Rust

This repository (will) contain(s) various _machine learning algorithms_ and in the future, _neural networks_. Everything in this repo intended to be written in C and/or Rust.

## Why does this repo exist?

Maybe for a challenge, because I want to improve myself in artificial intelligence field. I would have used Python, however I wanted extra challenge because I have never coded anything useful neither in C nor in Rust.

## List of algorithms

Here is a list of algorithms those I am planning to implement.

There will be respective **README files** where the algorithm is explained in. At the top of those files, _current progress of implementation will be there_.

1. Supervised Learning
    1. Decision Trees
    2. Linear Regression
    3. Logistic Regression
    4. k-nearest Neighbors _(k-NN)_

2. Unsupervised Learning
    1. _to be added_
